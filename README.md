# Prometheus - Magento Extension Creator

## Introduction

Prometheus is a Titan in Greek mythology credited for being the creator of mankind and for gifting them with fire stolen from Mount Olympus.
As the bringer of fire, Prometheus represents knowledge and ingenuity. It also represents the forces of creation.

This extension was named after Prometheus, because it's main goal is to bring extra fire to the Magento developer community,
by easing the process of Magento extension creation. It should empower the developers to enrich the ecosystem, with even more powerful extensions.

## Purpose

This extension will allow the creation of new Magento extensions without too much code. There's several extensions out there which allow you to do the same.
By no means Prometheus is the best option. It's another one, that hopefully, will serve your needs and ease your workflow.
Some aspects of Prometheus were inspired by the extension [Ultimate Module Creator](https://github.com/tzyganu/UMC1.9), from tzyganu.
